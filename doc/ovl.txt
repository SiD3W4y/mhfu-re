--- ovl files ---

As described in doc/runtime.txt ovl files are files used as swappable global
variables.

--[ Extracting the files

The ovl files can be found in the psp_game/usrdir/data.bin. This file is an
encrypted archive and can be decrypted and unpacked using the following tools:

 - https://github.com/svanheulen/mhff
 - https://github.com/svanheulen/mhef

--[ Format

struct OVLFile {
	// Header
	u8 magic[4]; // 4d 57 6f 33 or "MWo3"
	u32 unk_1; // @0x4
	u32 load_base; // Same as section vaddr in eboot.bin
	u32 unk_2; // @0xc, Always in the same order as the file size
	u32 unk_3; // @0x10
	u32 unk_4; // @0x14
	u32 unk_5; // @0x18
	u32 load_end; // @0x1c
	u8 name[0x60];

	// File contents
	u8 data[];
};

The header is present in memory when the ovl file is mapped and active.

After the last chunk of data (load_end), the files are padded with zeroes. The
criterion behind the amount of padding is not clear.
